# network-request-exercises
This project is just a very simple DOM that visualizes some network requests. You can set up a server with `express.js` and post and delete information. There are several features I plan to add in the next week including API selection and error handling. For now if you'd like to check out this project it's as simple as: 
- `git clone`
- `npm i`
- `open index.html`
- `npm start`

When I've built a more robust/usable app I'll update this README.
